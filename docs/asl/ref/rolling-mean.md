Mean of the values within a specified window. The mean will only be emitted
if there are at least a minimum number of actual values (not `NaN`) within
the window. Otherwise `NaN` will be emitted for that time period.

The window size, `n`, is the number of datapoints to consider including the current
value. There must be at least `minNumValues` non-NaN values within that window before
it will emit a mean. Note that it is based on datapoints, not a specific amount of time.
As a result the number of occurrences will be reduced when transitioning to a larger time
frame that causes consolidation.
