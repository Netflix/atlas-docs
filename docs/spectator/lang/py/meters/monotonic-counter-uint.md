A Monotonic Counter (uint64) is used to measure the rate at which an event is occurring, when the
source data is a monotonically increasing number. A minimum of two samples must be sent, in order to
calculate a delta value and report it to the backend as a rate-per-second. A variety of networking
metrics may be reported monotonically, and this metric type provides a convenient means of recording
these values, at the expense of a slower time-to-first metric.

Call `set()` when an event occurs:

```python
from ctypes import c_uint64
from spectator import Registry

registry = Registry()
registry.monotonic_counter_uint("iface.bytes").set(c_uint64(1))

iface_bytes = registry.new_id("iface.bytes")
registry.monotonic_counter_uint_with_id(iface_bytes).set(c_uint64(1))
```
