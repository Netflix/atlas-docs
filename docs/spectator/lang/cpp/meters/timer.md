A Timer is used to measure how long (in seconds) some event is taking.

Call `record()` with a value:

```cpp

```

A `StopWatch` class is available, which may be used as a [Context Manager] to automatically record
the number of seconds that have elapsed while executing a block of code:

```cpp

```
